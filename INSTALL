LigHTTPd:
=========

- Unpack somewhere outside of your webroot, i.e. /srv/http/php-directory-listing 
  if /srv/http/public_html is your webroot.

- Only if you cloned via Git: don't forget to do "git submodule init" and "git
  submodule update" in order to get the thirdparty components!

- Create a publicly accessible directory inside your webroot and link src, icons
  and thirdparty into it. For protection, it might be wise to add an empty
  index.html, too.

- Copy config.ini.template to config.ini and change according to your needs.
  This will be the global configuration file. You will have to at least enter
  the URL to the directory created in the last step here.

- In every subdirectory of your webroot that you want served with PHP Directory
  Listing, create a symlink to index.php. In the above example, say you want
  /srv/http/public_html/mydomain.com/pictures to be a directory listing, cd into
  that directory and then "ln -s /srv/http/php-directory-listing/index.php".

- If a directory needs different settings from what is set in the global 
  config.ini, copy config.ini into that directory (it won't be shown) and change
  the copy's settings accordingly. Be careful with permissions!

Apache:
=======

Unfortunately I do not run PHP Directory Listing with Apache, so I don't know if
it will work similarly or differently from how it can be setup with LigHTTPd. If
you would like to write the instructions for this section, I'd be happy to put
them here!
